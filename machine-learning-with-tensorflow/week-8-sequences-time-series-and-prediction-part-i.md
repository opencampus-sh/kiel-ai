# Week 8 - Sequences, Time Series and Prediction, Part I

### This week you will...

- take a look at some of the unique considerations involved when handling sequential time series data -- where values change over time, like the temperature on a particular day, or the number of visitors to your web site. We'll discuss various methodologies for predicting future values in these time series.
- begin to teach neural networks to recognize and predict on time series.

### Learning Resources

- Week 1 and 2 of the course [Sequences, Time Series and Prediction](https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-sequences-time-series-and-prediction)

### Until next week you should...

- complete week 3 and week 4 of the course [Sequences, Time Series and Prediction](https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-sequences-time-series-and-prediction)

- complete the second assignment of the following notebook:

  - [Assignment Notebook Time-Series Forecasting](https://colab.research.google.com/github.com/opencampus-sh/course-material/blob/main/machine-learning-with-tensorflow/week-08/Time_Series_Excersise.ipynb)

- working on the definition of your project's final model(s) and their evaluation according to the instructions given [here](https://github.com/opencampus-sh/ml-project-template/blob/main/3_Model/INSTRUCTIONS.md).

- document how you will evaluate your model results
