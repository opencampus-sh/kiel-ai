# Week 8 - Sequences, Time Series and Prediction, Part I

### This week you will...

* take a look at some of the unique considerations involved when handling sequential time series data -- where values change over time, like the temperature on a particular day, or the number of visitors to your web site. We'll discuss various methodologies for predicting future values in these time series.
* begin to teach neural networks to recognize and predict on time series.

### Learning Resources

* Week 1 and 2 of the course [Sequences, Time Series and Prediction](https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-sequences-time-series-and-prediction)

### Until next week you should...

* complete week 3 and week 4 of the course [Sequences, Time Series and Prediction](https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-sequences-time-series-and-prediction), including the provided assignments
* investigate the characteristics of your dataset:
  * What are the limitations for applications in practice?
  * Are there risks for bias?
  * For classification tasks: Are the categories of equal size?
  * How do you organize the data preparation?
