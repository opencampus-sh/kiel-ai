# Week 8

_**Note1:** Object Oriented Programming is a difficult but powerful concept, please take your time to revise the topic!_

_**Note 2:** If you want to install packages in the environment we set up during the course, you can do so by running_ `%pip install`_`package_name` (notice the %-sign!) e.g._ `%pip install PrettyTable` _in one of your notebook cells after you selected the environment. This is only needed once, after that it can always be reimported with_ `import`_._

Object Oriented Programming is not an easy concept. The video is almost three hours long!

For the best learning experience, it's recommended to watch the lecture twice: first for a quick overview, and then more slowly while taking notes. Please ensure you allocate sufficient time for this.

* **Work through the following homework assignment (short)**

Always first create a copy with "Copy to Drive" or download the notebooks to work locally on them. Otherwise your progress won't be saved.
