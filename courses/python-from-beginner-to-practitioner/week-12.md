# Final Project

* The deadline for submitting your well documented project is the **01/03/2025**
* You have to prepare a pitch presentation for the session of **21/01/2025**
* Your submission should tell a story:
  * What is the goal of the project?
  * What is the roadmap to reach that goal?
  * What did you try / did not work / can be improved upon?
* You have to at least hand in a Jupyter Notebook documenting code snippets, also if you are just working with .py files
* You can alternatively upload a zip file containing the Jupyter Notebook and needed project files (own libraries, ressources)&#x20;
* In a group project it should become clear, who participated and who worked on what part

#### General remarks on the project

* Use a GUI
  * Turtles at least, it has been demonstrated
  * Pygame is not difficult either
  * Tkinter? Others?
* Use of libraries is encouraged!
