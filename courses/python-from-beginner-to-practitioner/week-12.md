# Week 12

### To-Do

Homework:

* Prepare slides for a three minute presentation of your project progress
* Upload the PDF in the Mattermost channel

### Final Project

* The deadline for submitting your well documented project is the **01/08/2024**
* Your submission should tell a story:
  * What is the goal of the project?
  * What is the roadmap to reach that goal?
  * What did you try / did not work / can be improved upon?
* You have to at least hand in a Jupyter Notebook documenting code snippets, also if you are just working with .py files
* You can alternatively upload a zip file containing the Jupyter Notebook and needed project files (own libraries, ressources)&#x20;
* In a group project it should become clear, who participated and who worked on what part
