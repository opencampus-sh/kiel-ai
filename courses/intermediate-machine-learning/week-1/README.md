## **To-do**

ðŸ˜Š

1. Watch the following introduction video to the PyTorch framework

2. Watch all the videos on the next page - they are derived from a former Coursera Course
3. Go for your **own** through the Colab Notebook above (Pytorch101) and try  to **understand and repeat** the steps for your own. Thereby you should also solve Task 1-3 in the notebook. You can create therefore a copy of the notebook in your Drive or download the notebook to work locally on it. Ensure that you sufficient computing resources available (i.e gpu) if you choose to work locally.

Try to **improve the accuracy** in the PyTorch 101 notebook by tweaking the amount of layers and number of neurons
