### Until next week you should...

* [x] watch [this video](https://coursera.org/share/3f650f2a9fc3aef4a5ce140f99daf9a3) (5 minutes) on time series analyses.\

*   [x] choose one (or several) methods to replace the missing values in your dataset.


* [x] (if you haven't already) divide the tasks well within your team: Who will work on data optimization, and who on model optimization?
