# Week 7 - Neural Nets

### This week we will...

* learn about different libraries for implementing neural nets
* review example notebooks for the data preparation and training of neural net using Pandas and TensorFlow
* get to know additional types of layers in neural nets

### Learning Resources

{% file src="../../.gitbook/assets/250612_Neural Nets.pdf" %}

* Additional [introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvQwE2OhL8I) (12 Minuten) on neural nets
* [Example data preparation notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/opencampus-sh/einfuehrung-in-data-science-und-ml/blob/main/Neuronale%20Netze/neural_net_data_preparation.ipynb) for a neural net
* [Example notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/opencampus-sh/einfuehrung-in-data-science-und-ml/blob/main/Neuronale%20Netze/neural_net_estimation.ipynb) for training a neural net

### Until next week you should...

* [x] watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARq74QuavAo\&list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Hn0vK8co82zjQtt3T2Nkqc\&index=7) (7 minutes) to better understand the properties of dropout layers.
* [x] watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDCfw-YqWTE\&list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Hn0vK8co82zjQtt3T2Nkqc\&index=9) (5 minutes) to better understand the benefits of normalization.
* [x] complete the first chapter of [this course](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/dealing-with-missing-data-in-python/) on DataCamp to learn about identifying missing values.\

* [x] examine all your model variables for the existence of missing and implausible values.
* [x] prepare your dataset by correctly encoding all categorical features and removing all rows with missing values.
* [x] train a first neural network for your dataset.
