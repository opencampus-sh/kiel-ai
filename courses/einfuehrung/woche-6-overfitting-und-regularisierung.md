# Week 7 - Overfitting and Regularization

### This week we will...

cover the following topics:

* Important terms in machine learning
* Overfitting and regularization
* Model quality criteria
* Introduction to neural nets

### Learning Resources

{% file src="../../.gitbook/assets/250605_Overfitting and Model Evaluation.pdf" %}

* [Graphical tool](https://playground.tensorflow.org/) for the definition and estimation of neural networks for different example datasets
* [Example ](https://github.com/opencampus-sh/einfuehrung-in-data-science-und-ml/blob/main/overfitting.ipynb)of the effect of overfitting and regularization

### Until next week you should...

* [x] watch the videos of the sections “[Neural networks intuition](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/specializations/machine-learning/lesson/uyfti/welcome!)” and “[TensorFlow implementation](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/specializations/machine-learning/lesson/v1elo/inference-in-code)” from week 1 of the course Advanced Learning Algorithms from DeepLearning.AI<br>
* [x] further extend the dataset with additional variables that could be relevant for estimating revenue.
* [x] further test your baseline model's predictive performance on Kaggle!
