# Week 6 - Overfitting and Regularization

### This week we will...

cover the following topics:

* Important terms in machine learning
* Overfitting and regularization
* Model quality criteria
* Introduction to neural nets

### Learning Resources

{% file src="../../.gitbook/assets/250605_Overfitting and Model Evaluation.pdf" %}

* [Graphical tool](https://playground.tensorflow.org/) for the definition and estimation of neural networks for different example datasets
* [Example ](https://github.com/opencampus-sh/einfuehrung-in-data-science-und-ml/blob/main/overfitting.ipynb)of the effect of overfitting and regularization

### Until next week you should...

* [x] enroll into the Coursera course “[Advanced Learning ](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-learning-algorithms/)[Algorthms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-learning-algorithms/)” and watch the videos of the sections “Neural networks intuition” and “TensorFlow implementation”.\

* [x] further extend the dataset with additional variables that could be relevant for estimating revenue.
* [x] Test your model's predictive performance on Kaggle!
