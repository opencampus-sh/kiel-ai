# Week 5 - Introduction to Machine Learning and Linear Regression

### This week we will...

cover the following topics:

* Procedure for training machine learning algorithms
* Definition of linear regression
* Cost functions
* Optimization functions
* Testing your model on Kaggle

### Learning Resources

{% file src="../../.gitbook/assets/240523_Intro ML und Linear Regression.pdf" %}

{% file src="../../.gitbook/assets/IntroMLandLinReg.ipynb" %}

* [DataCamp Tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/essentials-linear-regression-python) on Linear Regression

### Until next week you should...

* [x] Watch the videos in the section "[The problem of overfitting](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/machine-learning/the-problem-of-overfitting-erGPe)" from Week 3 of the course "Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification" on Coursera.\

* [x] Split your dataset into a training set from 01.07.2013 to 31.07.2017, a validation set from 01.08.2017 to 31.07.2018, and a test set from 01.08.2018 to 31.07.2019.
* [x] Create an account on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) (using the same email address you used for EduHub).
* [x] Use a simple linear model to make a prediction for the test dataset and evaluate it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bakery-sales-prediction-summer-2025/data?select=sample_submission.csv) on Kaggle. (Ensure that the number of rows and the defined IDs match those in the [sample\_submission](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bakery-sales-prediction-summer-2025/data?select=sample_submission.csv) file!)
* [x] Further enrich the dataset with additional variables that may be relevant for estimating revenue and formulate a linear model equation that maximizes the adjusted R² for your training dataset.
* [x] Document the linear regression calculations in the “Baseline Model” directory of your team repository.\
