# Hello and welcome🤖

Great that you want to dive into the deep waters of Large Language Models and AI Agents. These are exciting times with major advancements on a quarterly basis with new models releases of OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek and so many more.&#x20;

This course brings you from beginner to intermediate or even advanced.&#x20;

On the next pages you can see what the content of each course week will be starting with what will happen during each of our course sessions.  I have divided the course into three levels of course work:

🤖 Beginner

The part after one 🤖 is **mandatory** for each course participant for a for successful participation.

🤖🤖 Intermediate

The part after two 🤖🤖 is voluntary but recommended.

🤖🤖🤖 Expert

The part after three 🤖🤖🤖 is completely voluntarily for the ones who really want to know.



Alternatively you can just follow the course as a spectator, you won't need to do any of the exercises but you also do not get a certificate. But though you will learn a lot about this exciting field!



Remember the course instructor(me) is also fallible so please question me if you see something that does not seem kind of right to you. Also always ask questions especially if you don't fully understand something. This is really why we give this course afterall so that you understand everything🤖

Own contributions or suggestions for improving the course as well as feedback are always welcome🤖

Let's dive right in!
