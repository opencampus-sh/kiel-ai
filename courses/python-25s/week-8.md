# Week 8

_**Note1:** Object Oriented Programming is a difficult but powerful concept, please take your time to revise the topic!_

_**Note 2:** If you want to install packages in the environment we set up during the course, you can do so by running_ `%pip install`_`package_name` (notice the %-sign!) e.g._ `%pip install PrettyTable` _in one of your notebook cells after you selected the environment. This is only needed once, after that it can always be reimported with_ `import`_. If it doesn't work (e.g. in Colab, try_ `!pip install`_`package_name` with ! instead of %)_
