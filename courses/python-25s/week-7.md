# Week 7

### To-Do (until 04/06/2025)

#### **Homework**

* Decide for one of the two final projects (they will be shown on your certificate)
  * Knowledge Cards: Flash Card Tool
  * Digital Pet: Interactive Virtual Companion
* List out what data the program has to handle (e.g. flash card with front and back, pet stats like hunger) and the matching data structures you need in python
* Create a flow chart for the program, like you have seen with hangman in the course:

* We will form groups of \~4 people and you will get time to discuss together

#### Optional Assignment

* Write a function `draw_arrow(n)`  that takes an integer `n` and prints the following pattern:

`n = 3`

```
  *
 ***
*****
  *
  *
```

`n = 5`

```
    *
   ***
  *****
 *******
*********
    *
    *

* Note that the length of the stem is always 2 and only the size of the arrowhead is changing
* Use a .ipynb file.
