# Final Project

* The deadline for submitting your well documented project is the **31/07/2025 23:59**
* You have to prepare a pitch presentation for the session on **02/07/2025**
* Your submission should tell a story:
  * What is the goal of the project?
  * What is the road map to reach that goal?
  * What did you try / did not work / can be improved upon?
* You have to at least hand in a Jupyter Notebook documenting code snippets (i.e. spotlights on important code parts), also if you are just working with .py files
* You can alternatively upload a zip file containing the Jupyter Notebook and needed project files (own libraries, resources, diagrams)&#x20;
* In a group project it should become clear, who participated and who worked on what part

#### General remarks on the project

* The project should at least look and feel like the Projects you build in the course
* Use a GUI
  * E.g. Tkinter (discussed in day 27)
  * Pygame is not difficult either
* Use of libraries in general is encouraged!

If you want to include graphics or other files, please contain **everything in one zip file**. The opencampus.sh system only accepts **single file uploads**. Subsequent uploads will overwrite previous submissions!
