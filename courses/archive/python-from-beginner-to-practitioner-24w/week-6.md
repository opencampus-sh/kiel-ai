# Week 6

### To-Do (Until 03/12/2024) <a href="#to-do" id="to-do"></a>

Homework:

* Do days 12 & 13 of the course
  * Watch the videos
  * Do the interactive coding exercises
* We will skip days 14 & 15, but you can still do them for practice

### Local Setup Instructions

Try to follow these instructions as far as possible, but at least step one. In the session we will walk through the setup process.

* Install Anaconda Distribution and Visual Studio Code
  * (If you are comfortable with the command line, you can just install [Miniconda](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe), [Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/navigator/install/) and VS Code to save on disk space)
  * [https://www.anaconda.com/download/success](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success) & [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  * Mac users: Move from Downloads to Applications to install VS Code system-wide
* Launch Anaconda Navigator
  * Under Environments create a new environment, e.g. _python\_course_, with a recent version of python (3.12+)
  * In the package listing for the environment change filter from „installed“ to „all“ then search and install the package _ipykernel_
  * Under Home launch VS Code (if not available launch it from system)
* In VS Code:
  * Install the extensions _Python_ and _Jupyter_ (both signed by Microsoft)
  * Create a new file: File > New File > Jupyter Notebook
  * Select Kernel > Another Kernel > Python Environments > _python\_course_ or whichever environment you just created
* Start Coding!

### Totally Optional

* **Watch lecture 6 of the Havard Python Course:**

For the best learning experience, it's recommended to watch the lecture twice: first for a quick overview, and then more slowly while taking notes. Please ensure you allocate sufficient time for this.

* **Work through the following homework assignment**
