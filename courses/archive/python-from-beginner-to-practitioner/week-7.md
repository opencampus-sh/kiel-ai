# Week 7

### To-Do

Homework:

* Decide for one of the two final projects (they will be shown on your certificate)
  * Knowledge Cards: Flash Card Tool
  * Digital Pet: Interactive Virtual Companion
* List out what data the program has to handle (e.g. flash card with front and back, pet stats like hunger) and the matching data structures you need in python
* Create a flow chart for the program, like you have seen with hangman in the course:

* We will form groups of \~5 people and you will get time to discuss together

### Totally Optional

* **Watch lecture 5 of the Havard Python Course:**

For the best learning experience, it's recommended to watch the lecture twice: first for a quick overview, and then more slowly while taking notes. Please ensure you allocate sufficient time for this.

Always first create a copy with "Copy to Drive" or download the notebooks to work locally on them. Otherwise your progress won't be saved!!
