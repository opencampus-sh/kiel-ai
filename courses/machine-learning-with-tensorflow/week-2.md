# Week 2 - Introduction to TensorFlow,Part I

### This week you will...

* get a soft introduction to what Machine Learning and Deep Learning are, and how they offer you a new programming paradigm, giving you a new set of tools to open previously unexplored scenarios. All you need to know is some very basic programming skills, and you'll pick the rest up as you go along.
* take the just learned new programming paradigm used in machine learning to the next level by beginning to solve problems of computer vision with just a few lines of code!
