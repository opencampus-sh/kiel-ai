# Week 2 - Introduction to TensorFlow,Part I

### This week you will...

* get a soft introduction to what Machine Learning and Deep Learning are, and how they offer you a new programming paradigm, giving you a new set of tools to open previously unexplored scenarios. All you need to know is some very basic programming skills, and you'll pick the rest up as you go along.
* take the just learned new programming paradigm used in machine learning to the next level by beginning to solve problems of computer vision with just a few lines of code!

* Week 1 and 2 of the course [Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow/)
* Don't forget to check out the important part of week 2 that is working through [this notebook](https://github.com/lmoroney/dlaicourse/blob/master/Course%201%20-%20Part%204%20-%20Lesson%202%20-%20Notebook.ipynb).

### Until next week you should...

* think about project ideas to present them in class.
* complete week 3 and week 4 of the course [Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow/).
* complete the two assignments in the following notebooks:
