# Week 5 - Convolutional Neural Networks, Part II

### This week you will...

* get familiar wit transfer learning, a powerful technique to include the knowledge of models that were trained on large datasets and benefit from the features these models already learned in your own problem scenario.
* move beyond binary classification into categorical classification and the specific coding considerations for the corresponding models.
* present your key findings for the literature review considering you selected project

{% hint style="warning" %}
**complete the first milestone, that is the&#x20;**_**literature review and descriptive statistics**_**, on Sunday before the feedback session next week!**\
\
**Follow the instructions given in the template repository and share the link to your project repository in the Google Sheet including the current list of projects, so we can review you completions there.**
