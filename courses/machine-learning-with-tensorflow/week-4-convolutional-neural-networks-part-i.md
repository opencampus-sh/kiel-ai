# Week 4 - Convolutional Neural Networks, Part I

### This week you will...

* go deeper into using ConvNets with real-world data and a much larger dataset than those you've been using thus far.
* learn about image augmentation, a technique to avoid overfitting by tweaking the training set to potentially increase the diversity of subjects it covers.
* discuss your project ideas.
