# Week 10 - Sequences, Time Series and Prediction

### This week you will...

* take a look at some of the unique considerations involved when handling sequential time series data -- where values change over time, like the temperature on a particular day, or the number of visitors to your web site. We'll discuss various methodologies for predicting future values in these time series.
* begin to teach neural networks to recognize and predict on time series.
* explore using Recurrent Neural networks (RNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks and see how useful they are to classify and predict on sequential data.
* add CNNs on top of Dnns and RNNs and put it together using a real world data series -- one which measures sunspot activity over hundreds of years,
