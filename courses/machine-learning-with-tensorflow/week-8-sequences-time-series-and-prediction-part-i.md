# Week 9 - Sequences, Time Series and Prediction, Part I

### This week you will...

* take a look at some of the unique considerations involved when handling sequential time series data -- where values change over time, like the temperature on a particular day, or the number of visitors to your web site. We'll discuss various methodologies for predicting future values in these time series.
* begin to teach neural networks to recognize and predict on time series.

### Learning Resources
