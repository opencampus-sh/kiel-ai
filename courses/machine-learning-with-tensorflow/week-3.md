# Week 3 - Introduction to TensorFlow,Part II

### This week you will...

* see how to improve the basic neural network for computer vision you learned last week.
* learn about what happens if your data is more complex; if the images are larger, or if the features are not always in the same place, and how to handle such issues.

### Learning Resources

{% file src="../../.gitbook/assets/250508_Introduction-to-TensorFlow-Part-II (1).pdf" %}

* Week 3 and 4 of the course [Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow/)

### Until next week you should...

* Watch the following videos:
  * [Neural Networks Part 8: Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGwBXDKFk9I\&list=PLblh5JKOoLUIxGDQs4LFFD--41Vzf-ME1\&index=15)(StatQuest with Josh Starmer, 15 min)
  * [C4W1L04 Padding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smHa2442Ah4\&list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Gl29AoE31iwdVwSG-KnDzF\&index=5) (DeepLearningAI, 9:50 min)
  * [C4W1L06 Convolutions Over Volumes](https://app.gitbook.com/u/WWDikjQ3eVgvMfPm7LVskOEkgST2) (DeepLearningAI, 11 min)
  * [C4W1L11 Why Convolutions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ay3zYUeuyhU\&list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Gl29AoE31iwdVwSG-KnDzF\&index=12) (DeepLearningAI, 9:40 min)
  * [C4W2L10 Data Augmentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JI8saFjK84o\&list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Gl29AoE31iwdVwSG-KnDzF\&index=22) (DeepLearningAI, 9:30 min)
  * [TensorFlow Tutorial 4 - Convolutional Neural Networks with Sequential and Functional API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAciKiDP2bo\&list=PLhhyoLH6IjfxVOdVC1P1L5z5azs0XjMsb\&index=5) (Aladdin Persson, 16 min)
* setup a repository for your project following the instructions given [here](https://opencampus.gitbook.io/opencampus-machine-learning-program/projects/requirements)
* Conduct a literature review according to the instructions given [here](https://github.com/opencampus-sh/ml-project-template/blob/main/0_LiteratureReview/INSTRUCTIONS.md)
* Document your findings on the literature review according to the instructions of above
* Complete the assignment in the following notebook:
  * [Assignment Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/opencampus-sh/course-material/blob/main/machine-learning-with-tensorflow/week-03/Assignment_Week3_Fast_Food_Image_Classification.ipynb)
* Optional:
  * Most videos this week come from this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArPaAX_PhIs\&list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Gl29AoE31iwdVwSG-KnDzF\&index=1) from DeepLearningAI covering Convolutional Neural Networks. We tried to select the most relevant videos covering basic concepts, but if you have some spare time, feel free to watch some more videos in there or even the entire playlist. It is definetly worthwhile (especially if you plan on doing a computer-vision project).
