# Week 3 - Introduction to TensorFlow,Part II

### This week you will...

* see how to improve the basic neural network for computer vision you learned last week.
* learn about what happens if your data is more complex; if the images are larger, or if the features are not always in the same place, and how to handle such issues.

### Learning Resources
