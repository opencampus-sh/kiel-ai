# Week 6 - Natural Language Processing, Part I

### This week you will...

- get an understanding for the importance of tokenization of a text when training a neural network for texts, for example, to do a sentiment analysis. Tokenization is the process of converting the text into numeric values, with a number representing a word or a character.
- learn about embeddings, where the text tokens are mapped as vectors in a high dimensional space. With embeddings and labelled examples, these vectors can then be tuned so that words with similar meaning will have a similar direction in the vector space. This will begin the process of training a neural network to understand sentiment in text -- and you'll begin by looking at movie reviews, training a neural network on texts that are labelled 'positive' or 'negative' and determining which words in a sentence drive those meanings.

### Learning Resources
