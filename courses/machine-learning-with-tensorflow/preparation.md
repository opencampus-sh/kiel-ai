# Preparation

### Before the first class you should ...

* register with Google and the Coursera platform to get corresponding accounts.\

* watch the videos [Neural Networks from the Ground Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk\&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1\_67000Dx\_ZCJB-3pi\&index=1) (19 minutes) and [Gradient Descen- How Neural Networks Learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHZwWFHWa-w\&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1\_67000Dx\_ZCJB-3pi\&index=2) (21 minutes)\
  It will help you getting familiar with the vocabulary and basic concepts in machine learning and get a first intuition for their meaning. Don't worry if you do not understand everything viewing it the first time, and maybe you want to watch the videos again at a later point in the course to understand more details.\

* do the introductory course on the basics of Python if you do not have any experience in Python yet: [https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python)
